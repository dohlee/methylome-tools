## Installation

Download current (2017.08.31) latest version of BSMAP.

```shell
wget http://lilab.research.bcm.edu/dldcc-web/lilab/yxi/bsmap/bsmap-2.90.tgz
tar xvf
```

Make binary files.

```shell
cd bsmap-2.90; make
```

(It would be convenient to save path to BSMAP binary so that we can access BSMAP binary by environment variable $BSMAP.)
